Pinwheel
========

A rails-like framework for building dynamic web applications in Perl.

Support for this application is best effort and there is no commitment to maintaining this application framework.


INSTALLATION
------------

	Pinwheel uses Module::Build to build and install the module.
	To install this module type the following:
	
		perl Build.PL
		./Build
		./Build test
		
	And then as root:
	
		./Build install


FRAMEWORK TESTS
---------------

  By default all the framework tests will be run against an SQLite database. 
  If you would like to run the tests against MySQL (running on localhost):
  
		./Build test_mysql
		
  Alternatively you can set the PINWHEEL_TEST_DB, PINWHEEL_TEST_USER and PINWHEEL_TEST_PASS
  environment variables.
  
  If you would like to only run the unit or functional tests:
  
    ./Build testunit
    ./Build testfunc
